# What would I do differently

Honestly, for this project, I would not do things differently because I felt like for this project, it was straightforward.

# What was the most difficult part for you

There was nothing really difficult about this project.

# What are my big take-aways from this project

The big takeaway from this project is automation for the analysis report. I canâ€™t imagine having to write a report for each day because that would be very time consuming.
