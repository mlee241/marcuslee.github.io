# What are my thoughts on R vs whatever other software I’ve used?

I’ve found R very easy to use compared to Python. This is primarily because I just do basic things in R such as making plots, running models, and cleaning data. However, if I can somehow add authentication to a R shiny app, or have the R shiny application/repository on AWS, and add a payment system in R, then I would consider it somewhat on the same level as Python.

# What functionality do I like about R?

I really like the chaining function in R and how you could create a simple web application in R.

# What parts do  I miss about the other language?

What I miss about using Python or in this case Django, is that I can add a lot more functionality to a web application. I realized in R, this is very limited and R is probably best suited if you are trying to sell an analytics service.

# Do you consider R a difficult language to learn?

I do not consider R a difficult language to learn because I’ve used R in my other statistics courses back in undergraduate years. When I was first learning R, I still found it easy to use because of the syntax and there are many ways to solve the problem.
