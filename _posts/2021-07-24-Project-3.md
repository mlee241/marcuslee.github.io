# What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do

Nothing has changed about what I think a data scientist is and what they do.

# What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward? Why or why not?

In terms of using R for data science, I do think maybe during the begininning of my career, I would assume I would use R for data science because I am comfortable with R. However, maybe like 2-3 years later, I would assume that I would use more Python instead because I am doing a lot of Python as of right now.

# What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?

Well, I guess it depends. But if I had a job where I had to present to stakeholders, I would probably use R shiny as an option.
