# What do you think being a data scientist is about?

Being a data scientist is about providing business insights or product insights based on analyzing data and models.

# What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?

For major duties, I would like to say analyzing data using Python, SQL, or R and running different models based off of the data But this depends where you work. In terms of knowledge areas, one needs to know Statistics(CLT, Bayesian Analysis, Regression Analysis, Probability, etc.), Data Structures(Depends on which Corporation you work for), Machine Learning Algorithms(This also depends as well), and a lot of programming languages/packages/topics(TensorFlow, Natural Language Processing, Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, pytorch, etc.)

# What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?

In terms of differences, I would have to say the data scientist role is more computationally heavy compared to statisticians(Like using multiple programming languages). In terms of similarities, I would have to say that both roles use Statistics and Statistics is the foundation for both of these roles.

# How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

Well, I don’t really see myself as a Statistician because I don’t consider myself a statistics expert. In terms of the data science field, I would not consider myself ready for these data scientist positions because of all the technical knowledge I need and I need experience to understand the business needs in the data scientist roles/product market fit.
